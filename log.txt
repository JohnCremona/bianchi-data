======================== HOWTO ADD MORE COMPUTED DATA TO DATABASE ============================

After computing Bianchi newforms for field d, levels from N1 to N2:

1. In bianchi-progs directory:

   export d=79
   export D=79
   export N1=1001
   export N2=5000
   echo $d -1 $N1 $N2 | ./nflist_loop >  ~/bianchi-data/newforms/newforms.$d.$N1-$N2
   wc -l ~/bianchi-data/newforms/newforms.$d.$N1-$N2
   grep data ~/bianchi-data/newforms/newforms.$d.$N1-$N2

   (count using wc -l and check that "data" is not in that file)

2.
   Assuming that we have used tmanin_loop on a range of levels N1-N2,
   there will be an output file called dimtabeis.$d.$N1-$N2. We no
   longer need this for LMFDB upload since we can run dimtabnew (up to
   level norm N2) making a file like dimtabeis.d.all.newdims but
   omitting cols 4 (full dimension) and 7 (eisenstein dimension),
   i.e. just
   field weight level dimcusp dimcuspnew
   e.g.
   23      2       6.1             1               1
   instead of
   23      2       6.1     12      1       1       11

   Instead of:
   mv ~/bianchi-progs/dimtabeis.$d.$N1-$N2 ~/bianchi-data/dims/
   cd ~/bianchi-data/dims/
   cat dimtabeis.$d.$N1-$N2 >> dimtabeis.$d.all
   cd ~/bianchi-progs
   sage
   sage: %runfile bianchi.py
   sage: d=19
   sage: # make dimtabeis.d.all.newdims
   sage: make_dimtabnew(d,"/home/jec/bianchi-data/dims/dimtabeis.{}.all".format(d))

   we can now do this:
   echo $d $N2 | ./dimtabnew >  ~/bianchi-data/dims/dimtabnew.${d}.1-${N2}

   Now follow instructions at the end of bianchi-progs/bianchi.py to
   make the LMFDB upload files:

# e.g. (assumes directory ~/bmf-upload exists)
# sage: %runfile bianchi.py
# sage: d=43 # square-free
# sage: D=43 # abs(disc), either d or 4*d
# sage: N1=1
# sage: N2=1000
# sage: # either (old style)
# sage: dimdat = read_dimtabeis_new(d, "dimtabeis.{}.all.newdims".format(d))
# sage: # or (new style)
# sage: dimdat = read_dimtabeis_new(d, "dimtabnew.{}.{}-{}".format(d, N1, N2))
# sage: sl2_levels = []
# sage: if D in [1,2,3,7,11,19,43,67,163,20]:
# sage:    sl2_levels = read_data("sl2_levels_{}".format(D), str)
# sage:    write_bmf_upload_file(dimdat, "bmf_dims.{}.{}-{}.sl2".format(d,N1,N2), 'dims', sl2=True)
# sage: write_bmf_upload_file(dimdat, "bmf_dims.{}.{}-{}.no_sl2".format(d,N1,N2), 'dims', sl2=False)
# sage: formdat = read_newforms(d, "newforms.{}.{}-{}".format(d,N1,N2))
# sage: write_bmf_upload_file(formdat, "bmf_forms.{}.{}-{}".format(d,N1,N2), 'forms', True)

# Copy the three files to legendre in bmf-upload/.
# Do the upload as follows:
# sage: from lmfdb import db
# sage: d=43
# sage: N1=1
# sage: N2=1000
# sage: db.bmf_forms.copy_from("/scratch/home/jcremona/bmf-upload/bmf_forms.{}.{}-{}".format(d,N1,N2))
# sage: db.bmf_dims.update_from_file("/scratch/home/jcremona/bmf-upload/bmf_dims.{}.{}-{}.sl2".format(d,N1,N2))
# sage: db.bmf_dims.copy_from("/scratch/home/jcremona/bmf-upload/bmf_dims.{}.{}-{}.no_sl2".format(d,N1,N2))


3. cd ~/bianchi-data
   git add 2.0.$D.1 # add the raw newform data files
   git add newforms/newforms.$d.$N1-$N2
   git add dims/dimtabnew.${d}.1-${N2}
   # or git add dims/dimtabeis.${d}.all
   git commit -m "..."
   git push origin master

4. (Can be done on another machine, if so "git pull origin master" in bianchi-data first)

   cd ecnf-data/sage
   sage
   sage: %runfile search.py
   sage: # field: int, e.g. 19

   sage: magma_search(d, bmf_filename=f"/home/jec/bianchi-data/newforms/newforms.{d}.1-{N2}", outfilename=f"rawcurves.2.0.{D}.1", verbose=True)

   Check the rawcurves file for gaps.
   Move the rawcurves file to ECNF_DIR/IQF
   Add the field if necessary to ECNF_DIR/sage/ecnf_fields and ECNF_DIR/IQF/fields.txt

   Process the raw curves file:

Use this to add entried to ecnf-data/sage/ecnf_fields:

sage: for D in srange(-250,-400,-1):
....:     if D.is_fundamental_discriminant():
....:         if D%4==1:
....:             print(f"2.0.{abs(D)}.1 [{(1-D)//4},-1,1]")
....:         else:
....:             print(f"2.0.{abs(D)}.1 [{-D//4},0,1]")
....:

Use this to process several fields (replace '1-100' as appropriate)

sage: def proc(D):
....:     field_label = f'2.0.{D}.1'
....:     rawcurvesfile = ".".join(['rawcurves', field_label,'1-100'])
....:     data = read_curves_magma(ECNF_DIR+"/IQF/"+rawcurvesfile)
....:     n = len(list(data))
....:     print(f"{n} raw curves over field {field_label}")
....:     data = read_curves_magma(ECNF_DIR+"/IQF/"+rawcurvesfile)
....:     curves = make_all_data_files1(data, field_type='IQF', field_label=field_label, verbose=0, prec=128)


   sage: %runfile files.py
   sage: d=6
   sage: D=24
   sage: field_label = f'2.0.{D}.1'
   sage: rawcurvesfile = ".".join(['rawcurves', field_label,'1-100'])
   sage: data = read_curves_magma(ECNF_DIR+"/IQF/"+rawcurvesfile)
   sage: len(list(data))
   sage: data = read_curves_magma(ECNF_DIR+"/IQF/"+rawcurvesfile)
   sage: curves = make_all_data_files1(data, field_type='IQF', field_label=field_label, verbose=0, prec=128)

This produces files of the form curves.2.0.251.1.part.  If complete,
remove the ".part".

#
# Either (for a new field) upload all curves in a file:
