======================== HOWTO ADD MORE COMPUTED DATA TO DATABASE ============================

After computing Bianchi newforms for field d, levels from N1 to N2:

1. In bianchi-progs directory:

   export d=79
   export D=79
   export N1=1001
   export N2=5000
   echo $d -1 $N1 $N2 | ./nflist_loop >  ~/bianchi-data/newforms/newforms.$d.$N1-$N2
   wc -l ~/bianchi-data/newforms/newforms.$d.$N1-$N2
   grep data ~/bianchi-data/newforms/newforms.$d.$N1-$N2

   (count using wc -l and check that "data" is not in that file)

2.  Assuming that we have used makenf_loop on a range of levels N1-N2,
   we run dimtabnew (up to level norm N2) making a file
   dimtabnew.d.N1-N2:

   echo $d $N2 | ./dimtabnew >  ~/bianchi-data/dims/dimtabnew.${d}.1-${N2}

   Now follow instructions at the end of bianchi-progs/bianchi.py to
   make the LMFDB upload files:

# e.g. (assumes directory ~/bmf-upload exists)
# sage: %runfile bianchi.py
# sage: d=43 # square-free
# sage: D=43 # abs(disc), either d or 4*d
# sage: N1=1
# sage: N2=1000
# sage: # either (old style)
# sage: dimdat = read_dimtabeis_new(d, f"dimtabeis.{d}.all.newdims")
# sage: # or (new style)
# sage: dimdat = read_dimtabeis_new(d, f"dimtabnew.{d}.{N1}-{N2}")
# sage: sl2_levels = []
# sage: if D in [1,2,3,7,11,19,43,67,163,20]:
# sage:    sl2_levels = read_data(f"sl2_levels_{D}", str)
# sage:    write_bmf_upload_file(dimdat, f"bmf_dims.{d}.{N1}-{N2}.sl2", 'dims', sl2=True)
# sage: write_bmf_upload_file(dimdat, f"bmf_dims.{d}.{N1}-{N2}.no_sl2", 'dims', sl2=False)
# sage: formdat = read_newforms(d, f"newforms.{d}.{N1}-{N2}")
# sage: write_bmf_upload_file(formdat, f"bmf_forms.{d}.{N1}-{N2}", 'forms', True)

or simply (for any fields with no sl2 data)

# sage: dimdat = read_dimtabeis_new(d, f"dimtabnew.{d}.{N1}-{N2}")
# sage: sl2_levels = []
# sage: write_bmf_upload_file(dimdat, f"bmf_dims.{d}.{N1}-{N2}", 'dims', sl2=False)
# sage: formdat = read_newforms(d, f"newforms.{d}.{N1}-{N2}")
# sage: write_bmf_upload_file(formdat, f"bmf_forms.{d}.{N1}-{N2}", 'forms', True)

or for several fields d together, same N1 and N2 (and no sl2 data)

# sage: dimdat = read_dimtabeis_many(dlist, N1, N2)
# sage: sl2_levels = []
# sage: Dlist = [d if d%4==3 else 4*d for d in dlist]
# sage: DD = "-".join(str(D) for D in Dlist)
# sage: write_bmf_upload_file(dimdat, f"bmf_dims.{DD}.{N1}-{N2}", 'dims', sl2=False)
# sage: formdat = read_newforms_many(dlist, N1, N2)
# sage: write_bmf_upload_file(formdat, f"bmf_forms.{DD}.{N1}-{N2}", 'forms', True)


# Copy the two/three files to legendre in bmf-upload/.
# Do the upload as follows:
# sage: from lmfdb import db
# sage: d=43
# sage: N1=1
# sage: N2=1000
# sage: db.bmf_forms.copy_from(f"/scratch/home/jcremona/bmf-upload/bmf_forms.{d}.{N1}-{N2}")
and
# sage: db.bmf_dims.update_from_file(f"/scratch/home/jcremona/bmf-upload/bmf_dims.{d}.{N1}-{N2}.sl2")
# sage: db.bmf_dims.copy_from(f"/scratch/home/jcremona/bmf-upload/bmf_dims.{d}.{N1}-{N2}.no_sl2")
or just
# sage: db.bmf_dims.copy_from(f"/scratch/home/jcremona/bmf-upload/bmf_dims.{d}.{N1}-{N2}")

3. cd ~/bianchi-data
   git add 2.0.$D.1 # add the raw newform data files
   git add newforms/newforms.$d.$N1-$N2
   git add dims/dimtabnew.${d}.1-${N2}
   # or git add dims/dimtabeis.${d}.all
   git commit -m "..."
   git push origin master

4. (Can be done on another machine, if so "git pull origin master" in bianchi-data first)

   cd ecnf-data/sage
   sage
   sage: %runfile search.py
   sage: # field: int, e.g. 19
   sage: magma_search(field,bmf_filename="...", outfilename="...", verbose=False)
   sage: # eg
   sage: d=5
   sage: D=20
   sage: N1=1
   sage: N2=1000
   sage: magma_search(d, bmf_filename=f"/home/jec/bianchi-data/newforms/newforms.{d}.{N1}-{N2}", outfilename=f"rawcurves.2.0.{D}.1.{N1}-{N2}", verbose=True)
   # or
   sage: magma_search(d, bmf_filename=f"/home/jec/bianchi-data/newforms/newforms.{d}.1-{N2}", min_norm=N1, outfilename=f"rawcurves.2.0.{D}.1.{N1}-{N2}", verbose=True)

NB For searching on a range with N1>1 there is no need to make a
separate newforms file, use the min_norm parameter of magma_search().

   Check the rawcurves file for gaps.
   Move the rawcurves file to ECNF_DIR/IQF

   [Optional: Add the field if necessary to ECNF_DIR/sage/ecnf_fields and
   ECNF_DIR/IQF/fields.txt; for quadratic fields the creation of
   fields from labels is done on the fly if the label is not in the
   list.]

   Process the raw curves file:

Use this to add entries to ecnf-data/sage/ecnf_fields if desired:

sage: for D in srange(-250,-400,-1):
....:     if D.is_fundamental_discriminant():
....:         if D%4==1:
....:             print(f"2.0.{abs(D)}.1 [{(1-D)//4},-1,1]")
....:         else:
....:             print(f"2.0.{abs(D)}.1 [{-D//4},0,1]")
....:

Use this to process several fields (replace '1-100' as appropriate)

sage: def proc(D):
....:     field_label = f'2.0.{D}.1'
....:     rawcurvesfile = ".".join(['rawcurves', field_label,'16-100'])
....:     data = read_curves_magma(ECNF_DIR+"/IQF/"+rawcurvesfile)
....:     n = len(list(data))
....:     print(f"{n} raw curves over field {field_label}")
....:     data = read_curves_magma(ECNF_DIR+"/IQF/"+rawcurvesfile)
....:     curves = make_all_data_files1(data, field_type='IQF', field_label=field_label, verbose=0, prec=128, backend='pari')


   sage: %runfile files.py
   sage: d=6
   sage: D=24
   sage: field_label = f'2.0.{D}.1'
   sage: rawcurvesfile = ".".join(['rawcurves', field_label,'1-100'])
   sage: data = read_curves_magma(ECNF_DIR+"/IQF/"+rawcurvesfile)
   sage: len(list(data))
   sage: data = read_curves_magma(ECNF_DIR+"/IQF/"+rawcurvesfile)
   sage: curves = make_all_data_files1(data, field_type='IQF', field_label=field_label, verbose=0, prec=128, backend='pari')

This produces files of the form curves.2.0.251.1.part.  If complete,
remove the ".part".

export fnames='curves isoclass local_data mwdata galrep'
DD='299 251'
for D in $DD; do for f in ${fnames}; do wc -l ${f}.2.0.${D}.1.part; done; done
EITHER (if a first run from norm 1)
for D in $DD; do for f in ${fnames}; do mv ${f}.2.0.${D}.1.part ${f}.2.0.${D}.1; done; done
OR (if a subsequent run)
for D in $DD; do for f in ${fnames}; do cat ${f}.2.0.${D}.1.part >> ${f}.2.0.${D}.1; done; done
